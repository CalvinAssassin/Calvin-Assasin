Android phone app for the CS262 Assassin game project

# Vision Statement
"Assassin" is a particularly popular live action game on college campuses across the US, where players act as both a hunter and a target for other players. Players must "Assassinate" their target and attempt to be the last remaining player alive. Despite being enormously fun to play, very few people ever have the motivation to organize a game, due in part to the amount of planning and coordination involved. CalvinAssassin takes the tedious work out of planning a game of Assassin, and allows users to simply join games and have fun; The server takes care of the rest. Few mobile applications have been made to do a similar task, and those that already exist are unreliable, charge money for premium features, or don't make it clear who your target is. CalvinAssassin has none of these issues. Its completely free to play, local to Calvin College, and doesn't make it a pain to find your target while still being challenging and exciting.
